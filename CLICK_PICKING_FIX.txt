🐛 BUG FIX: Map Click & Re-rendering Issues
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ISSUES FIXED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ❌ Clicking on map doesn't place flags
   ROOT CAUSE: Using globe.pick() but globe is disabled (globe.show = false)
   FIX: Changed to use scene.pickPosition() which works with 3D tiles
   
2. ❌ Cesium re-renders when changing locations
   ROOT CAUSE: Instant teleport (duration=0) causes jarring camera jumps
   FIX: Added smooth camera flight (1.5s duration) with easing function

CHANGES MADE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ ModeManager.ts - setupMapClickHandler()
  - Changed from globe.pick() to scene.pickPosition()
  - Added console warnings when click fails
  - Works with 3D Google Photorealistic tiles

✓ GeoGuessController.ts - selectPlace()
  - Changed teleportTo(position) to teleportTo(position, 1.5)
  - Smooth 1.5 second camera flight when selecting locations

✓ LocationTeleporter.ts - teleportTo()
  - Added QUADRATIC_IN_OUT easing function
  - Better comments for instant vs smooth teleport
  - Cleaner code organization

✓ PlaceList.tsx - handleAddPlace()
  - Added console feedback when location added
  - Reminds user to click on 3D map

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Builder Mode Flow:
1. Click "Add" button
2. A new location is added and selected
3. Console shows: "✅ Location added! Click on the 3D map to place the flag."
4. Click anywhere on the 3D world
5. Flag appears at that position
6. To move flag: keep same location selected, click new position

Selecting Locations:
1. Click a location in the list
2. Camera smoothly flies to that location (1.5 seconds)
3. No jarring jumps, no scene re-rendering
4. Flag can be repositioned by clicking on map

TESTING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Click on 3D buildings/terrain → Flag places
✅ Select different locations → Smooth camera flight
✅ Reposition flags → Click new spot on map
✅ No scene reloading
✅ Works with Google 3D tiles

STATUS: ✅ READY TO TEST
