🧪 QUICK TEST GUIDE - GeoGuess Flag Placement
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. ✅ Map clicking now works (uses pickPosition instead of globe.pick)
2. ✅ Smooth camera transitions (no more jarring jumps)
3. ✅ Better console feedback

📝 HOW TO TEST:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: Refresh Browser
  - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

Step 2: Enter Builder Mode
  - Main Menu → GeoGuess → Create Challenge
  - Should see builder UI (left sidebar)

Step 3: Add Location
  - Click "Add" button in left sidebar
  - Console should show: "✅ Location added! Click on the 3D map..."
  - A new location appears in the list (selected/highlighted)

Step 4: Place Flag
  - Click anywhere on the 3D world (buildings, ground, etc.)
  - Should see console: "📍 Flag placed at: {lat, lon, height}"
  - A yellow flag cylinder should appear at click location

Step 5: Test Movement
  - With same location still selected, click different spot
  - Flag should move to new position
  - Smooth, no re-rendering

Step 6: Test Selection
  - Add another location (repeat steps 3-4)
  - Click first location in list
  - Camera should smoothly fly to that location
  - Should see both flags (yellow = selected, red = others)

🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Flags appear where you click
✅ Smooth camera transitions (1.5s flight)
✅ No scene reloading/flickering
✅ Console feedback guides you
✅ Yellow flag = selected location
✅ Red flags = other locations

⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Flag doesn't appear? → Check if location is selected (highlighted in list)
- Click not working? → Check console for warnings
- Console shows "No place selected"? → Click "Add" or select from list first
- Console shows "Could not pick position"? → Click on loaded terrain/buildings

Let me know if it works! 🚀
