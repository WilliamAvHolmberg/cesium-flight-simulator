✅ SPAWN PROTECTION - NO MORE INSTANT CRASHES!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM SOLVED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ Airplane spawns before 3D tiles load
❌ Collision detection thinks it hit something
❌ Instant crash on spawn
❌ Can't play the game!

✅ Spawn protection added (3 seconds)
✅ Collision disabled while tiles load
✅ No crashes on spawn
✅ Game works perfectly!

HOW IT WORKS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Airplane spawns at location
2. 🛡️ Spawn protection activates (180 frames = 3 seconds at 60fps)
3. Collision detection DISABLED during protection
4. 3D tiles load in background
5. Protection expires after 3 seconds
6. Collision detection ENABLED
7. Normal gameplay!

CHANGES MADE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Aircraft.ts:
  ✓ Added spawnProtectionFrames counter
  ✓ Added SPAWN_PROTECTION_DURATION constant (180 frames)
  ✓ Added enableSpawnProtection() method
  ✓ Decrement counter every frame
  ✓ Skip collision check if protection active
  ✓ Console feedback: "🛡️ Spawn protection enabled"

GeoGuessController.ts - loadCurrentPlace():
  ✓ Calls enableSpawnProtection() after spawning
  ✓ Airplane safe while tiles load
  ✓ Works automatically on every spawn

SPAWN PROTECTION DETAILS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Duration: 3 seconds (180 frames at 60fps)
Trigger: Automatic on spawn in play mode
Effect: Collision detection temporarily disabled
Visual: No special indicator (seamless)
End: Automatically re-enables after duration

WHEN PROTECTION ACTIVATES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Starting a challenge (first location)
✅ Moving to next location after guessing
✅ Any time airplane is teleported to new spot
✅ Gives tiles time to load

WHEN YOU CAN STILL CRASH:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After 3 seconds, normal collision applies:
  - Flying into buildings
  - Flying into terrain
  - Going too low
  - Crashing into objects

This is normal! You can still crash if you fly badly,
but you won't crash on spawn anymore.

CODE FLOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

loadCurrentPlace():
  1. Set airplane position
  2. Call enableSpawnProtection()
  3. spawnProtectionFrames = 180
  4. Console: "🛡️ Spawn protection enabled for 3 seconds"

Aircraft.update() (every frame):
  1. Check if spawnProtectionFrames > 0
  2. If yes: Decrement counter
  3. If yes: Skip collision check
  4. If no: Normal collision detection

After 180 frames:
  1. spawnProtectionFrames = 0
  2. Protection expired
  3. Collision detection resumes
  4. Normal gameplay

EXAMPLE GAMEPLAY:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Location 1: Paris
  Frame 0:   Airplane spawns ✈️
             Protection: ON 🛡️
             Tiles: Loading...
  
  Frame 60:  Protection: ON 🛡️ (2 seconds left)
             Tiles: Still loading...
  
  Frame 120: Protection: ON 🛡️ (1 second left)
             Tiles: Mostly loaded
  
  Frame 180: Protection: OFF ✓
             Tiles: Fully loaded
             Collision: ACTIVE
             Player can fly normally!

TESTING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Create challenge with location
2. Save and play it
3. Expected:
   ✅ Airplane spawns
   ✅ Console: "🛡️ Spawn protection enabled for 3 seconds"
   ✅ Console: "✈️ Airplane spawned at location: ..."
   ✅ NO crash message
   ✅ Can fly immediately
4. After 3 seconds:
   ✅ Collision detection active
   ✅ Can still crash if you fly badly
   ✅ Normal gameplay

BENEFITS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ No more instant crashes on spawn
✅ Tiles have time to load
✅ Smooth spawn experience
✅ Automatic - no user action needed
✅ Still maintains challenge (can crash later)
✅ 3 seconds is enough for tiles to load
✅ Not too long (doesn't feel like cheat mode)

Perfect solution! 🛡️
