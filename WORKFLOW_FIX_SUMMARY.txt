✅ WORKFLOW & TELEPORT FIXES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ISSUES FIXED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ❌ Minimap doesn't work in GeoGuess mode
   FIX: Updated GameBridge.teleportTo() to handle camera-only teleportation
   RESULT: Minimap now works! Click to teleport camera

2. ❌ New locations not auto-selected
   FIX: Restored selectPlace() call after adding location
   RESULT: Click "Add" → location selected, ready to place flag

3. ❌ Lat/lon auto-populated when adding location
   FIX: Start with (0,0,0) placeholder position
   RESULT: No position until user clicks on map

4. ❌ Tried to teleport to locations without positions
   FIX: Check if position is valid before teleporting
   RESULT: No teleport attempt for unplaced locations

5. ❌ Flags showing at (0,0,0) before placement
   FIX: Only render flags with valid positions
   RESULT: Clean map, flags only appear after placement

CHANGES MADE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ GameBridge.ts - teleportTo()
  - Detects if in GeoGuess mode
  - GeoGuess: Teleports camera (flyTo with easing)
  - Flight Sim: Teleports vehicle (setState)
  - Works for minimap, location search, etc.

✓ useChallengeBuilder.ts - addPlace()
  - Creates place with (0,0,0) placeholder
  - No getCurrentPosition() call
  - User must click map to set actual position

✓ PlaceList.tsx - handleAddPlace()
  - Calls selectPlace() after adding
  - Location auto-selected
  - Console: "✅ Location added! Now click on the 3D map..."

✓ GeoGuessController.ts - selectPlace()
  - Checks if position is valid (not 0,0,0)
  - Only teleports if position exists
  - Console feedback if no position yet

✓ GeoGuessController.ts - updateBuildModeFlags()
  - Only renders flags with valid positions
  - No flags at (0,0,0)
  - Clean visual state

NEW WORKFLOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: Navigate to location
  - Use LocationSelector (search)
  - Use MiniMap (click to teleport) ← NOW WORKS!
  - Use manual controls (mouse + WASD)

STEP 2: Add location
  - Click "Add" button
  - Location created with no position yet
  - Location auto-selected
  - Console: "✅ Location added! Now click on the 3D map..."

STEP 3: Place flag
  - Click anywhere on 3D map
  - Flag appears at clicked position
  - Position saved to location
  - Done!

STEP 4: Reposition if needed
  - Click location in list (teleports if has position)
  - Click new spot on map
  - Flag moves to new position

STEP 5: Repeat
  - Search for next place
  - Add location
  - Click to place
  - Continue building challenge!

TELEPORT BEHAVIOR:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Minimap Click:
  - GeoGuess Mode: ✅ Camera flies to clicked position
  - Flight Sim: ✅ Vehicle teleports to clicked position

LocationSelector:
  - GeoGuess Mode: ✅ Camera flies to searched location
  - Flight Sim: ✅ Vehicle teleports to searched location

Select Location (List):
  - Has Position: ✅ Camera flies there smoothly
  - No Position: ⏭️ No teleport, just selects for placement

VISUAL FEEDBACK:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Location in List:
  - Red text = Not placed yet (no position)
  - Normal text = Has position

Flags on Map:
  - Yellow flag = Currently selected location
  - Red flags = Other locations
  - No flag = Location not placed yet

Console Messages:
  - "✅ Location added! Now click on the 3D map..."
  - "📍 Location selected (no position set yet)..."
  - "📍 Flag placed at: {lat, lon, height}"
  - "🗺️ Camera teleported to: {lat, lon}"

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Search "Eiffel Tower" in LocationSelector
   → Camera flies to Paris ✅

2. Click "Add"
   → "Location 1" created (no position)
   → Location auto-selected
   → Ready to place flag

3. Click on Eiffel Tower in 3D view
   → Yellow flag appears at clicked spot ✅
   → Position saved

4. Click minimap on New York area
   → Camera flies to New York ✅

5. Click "Add"
   → "Location 2" created
   → Auto-selected

6. Click on Statue of Liberty
   → Yellow flag appears there ✅

7. Want to adjust Location 1?
   → Click "Location 1" in list

Perfect workflow! 🎯
