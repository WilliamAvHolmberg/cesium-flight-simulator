✅ COLLISION DISABLED IN GEOGUESS MODE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WAS DONE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Aircraft.ts:
  ✓ Added collisionEnabled flag (public, defaults to true)
  ✓ Collision check now checks: collisionEnabled && spawnProtectionFrames <= 0
  ✓ Can be toggled per mode

ModeManager.ts - enterGeoGuessPlayMode():
  ✓ Sets collisionEnabled = false
  ✓ Console: "🛡️ Collision detection DISABLED for GeoGuess mode"
  ✓ Airplane can fly anywhere without crashing

RESULT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In GeoGuess Play Mode:
  ✅ Airplane spawns
  ✅ NO collision detection
  ✅ Can fly through anything
  ✅ Can see what's really happening
  ✅ No crashes ever

In Flight Sim Mode:
  ✅ Collision enabled (default)
  ✅ Normal crash behavior
  ✅ Can still crash into things

NOW YOU CAN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ See if tiles are loading properly
✓ See if airplane spawns correctly
✓ Fly through buildings/terrain to explore
✓ Test the tile loading sequence
✓ Debug any other issues
✓ No crash messages to confuse things

Console will show:
  🎮 Entering GeoGuess Play mode...
  🛡️ Collision detection DISABLED for GeoGuess mode
  ✅ GeoGuess Play mode active - Airplane enabled, NO COLLISION
  
  📷 Moving camera to location: Paris...
