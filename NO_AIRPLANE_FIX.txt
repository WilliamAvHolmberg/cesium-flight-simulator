✅ AIRPLANE REMOVED FROM GEOGUESS MODES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM SOLVED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ Airplane rendered in GeoGuess modes
❌ Everything centered around airplane
❌ Couldn't move freely

✅ Airplane now hidden in GeoGuess modes
✅ Free camera from the start
✅ No vehicle constraints

WHAT CHANGED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ModeManager.ts - enterGeoGuessBuilderMode()
  ✓ Hides airplane model (vehicle.model.show = false)
  ✓ Disables vehicle physics
  ✓ Positions camera high above Earth (5000km altitude)
  ✓ Looking down at planet (-90° pitch)
  ✓ Free camera controls enabled
  ✓ No vehicle in the way!

ModeManager.ts - enterGeoGuessPlayMode()
  ✓ Hides airplane model
  ✓ Disables vehicle physics
  ✓ Free camera controls enabled
  ✓ No vehicle visible

ModeManager.ts - exitBuilderMode()
  ✓ Shows airplane model again (vehicle.model.show = true)
  ✓ Re-enables physics
  ✓ Restores follow camera
  ✓ Back to flight sim mode

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

GEOGUESS BUILDER MODE:
1. Select "GeoGuess" → "Create Challenge"
2. Camera starts at 5000km altitude, looking down at Earth
3. No airplane visible
4. Use LocationSelector to search for places
5. Use MiniMap to navigate
6. Free camera movement (mouse + WASD)
7. Click "Add" to create locations
8. Pure freedom!

GEOGUESS PLAY MODE:
1. Select "GeoGuess" → "Play Challenge"
2. Select a challenge
3. Teleports to first location
4. No airplane visible
5. Free camera to explore
6. Make your guess
7. Next location!

FLIGHT SIM MODE:
1. Main Menu → "Flight Simulator"
2. Cinematic sequence plays
3. Airplane spawns
4. Follow camera active
5. Normal flight sim experience

MODE SEPARATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Flight Sim:     🛩️ Airplane visible + Follow camera
Builder Mode:   🏗️ No vehicle + Object placement
GeoGuess Build: 🗺️ No vehicle + Free camera + Flags
GeoGuess Play:  🎮 No vehicle + Free camera + Guessing

Each mode is completely independent!

CAMERA START POSITIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Flight Sim:      At airplane spawn location
Builder:         Behind/above vehicle
GeoGuess Build:  5000km above Earth (lat: 0, lon: 20)
GeoGuess Play:   At first challenge location

TESTING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Refresh browser
2. Main Menu → GeoGuess → Create Challenge
3. Expected:
   ✅ Camera high above Earth
   ✅ No airplane visible
   ✅ Can see planet
   ✅ Free to move around
4. Search for "Paris"
5. Expected:
   ✅ Camera flies to Paris
   ✅ Still no airplane
   ✅ Can explore freely
6. Return to Main Menu → Flight Simulator
7. Expected:
   ✅ Airplane spawns
   ✅ Follow camera active
   ✅ Normal flight experience

Perfect separation! 🎯
