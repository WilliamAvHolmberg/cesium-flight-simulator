✅ CAMERA & NAVIGATION FIX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ISSUES FIXED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ❌ Camera moves/rotates when adding location
   FIX: Removed auto-select after adding location
   RESULT: Camera stays put, location added at current position

2. ❌ No minimap in builder mode
   FIX: Added MiniMap component to builder UI
   RESULT: Can see and click minimap to navigate

3. ❌ No location search in builder mode
   FIX: Added LocationSelector component to builder UI
   RESULT: Can search for places and teleport there

CHANGES MADE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ PlaceList.tsx - handleAddPlace()
  - Removed selectPlace() call after adding
  - Location added but NOT selected
  - Camera doesn't move at all
  - Better console message

✓ PlaceList.tsx - handleSelectPlace()
  - Added console message explaining you can now reposition
  - User knows when they can click to reposition flag

✓ GeoGuessBuilderUI.tsx
  - Added MiniMap component (bottom-right)
  - Added LocationSelector component (top-right)
  - Updated help text at bottom
  - Clean UI layout

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADDING LOCATIONS (No camera movement!):
1. Navigate freely to any position using:
   - Mouse + WASD controls
   - LocationSelector search bar
   - MiniMap clicking
2. When at desired spot, click "Add"
3. Location created at current camera position
4. Flag appears at that spot
5. Camera DOES NOT move!
6. Console: "✅ Location added at current camera position!"

REPOSITIONING FLAGS:
1. Click a location in the list
2. Camera flies to that location (smooth 1.5s)
3. Console: "📍 Location selected. You can now click on the map..."
4. Click on 3D map to move the flag
5. Flag updates to new position

NAVIGATION TOOLS:

UI LAYOUT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Top-Left:        Challenge metadata + location list + editor
Top-Right:       Save/Preview/Exit buttons
                 LocationSelector (search)
